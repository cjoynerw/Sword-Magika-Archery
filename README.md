# Sword-Magika-Archery

<h2>Title: Sword, Magika, Archery <br>
Type: Project <br>
Creator: Christian Joyner-Williams <br>
Goal: Engage the player in an awesome adventure! <br>

<h2>User Story</h2> <br>
<h3>User can press start button to begin. Screen will shift to side view and begin. User will then be able to pick from 3 attacks. Attacks will continue until player or CPU no longer has Health Points. When player Health Points reach zero, the game is over.</h3> <br>
<h2>My Approach and Problems I Faced</h2>
<h3>Going into the project I was really looking to solidify some of the basics I learned in my first 2 weeks in General Assembly's Software Engineering immersive program. Some of the problems I faced was figuring out how to add sound effects with correct timiing as well as creating *some* animation for my game.</h3>
